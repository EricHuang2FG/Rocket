A rocket simulator that simulates the flight of rockets!

The up and down arrow keys control the angle of attack of the rocket. Left `Ctrl` decreases the throttle while left `Shift` increases the throttle.

Only the `Launch` button is available as of now. Visuals are added for `Soyuz 2.1a` and `CZ-5B` but not for `Brick`.
